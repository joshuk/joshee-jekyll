<h3><span>the basics</span></h3>

My portfolio website was created in June 2020, and was designed to house both my work as a developer as well as any other little things that I wanted to show off or talk about.

It's built as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site using vanilla CSS and Javascript. It's hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and uses [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) for content population.
